title: The Pale Blue Dot Society

## Goal

Nobody on Earth lacks the basics: food, water, clothing, shelter,
medical care, and security.

## Why Now?

We are at a unique period of history where we have the technology and
motivation to actually make this happen. We can do this without
forcing our will upon those who don't want to help.

## Non-Goals

Inequality of wealth is
irrelevant to our goal. We don't care that some have more than
others as long as those with the least have a life with dignity.

## Methods

Drive the cost of basic versions of these goods to zero, or as close
to zero as possible. Then provide everyone on earth with enough
universal basic income to buy these goods.

Let's take these two statements as a given: 1. We are already
extremely productive as a society and 2. Our productivity will
accelerate as robotics and machine intelligence take over a greater
percentage of our work.

Machines can do things that would be absurdly time consuming, not to
mention annoying, for humans. For example, the most efficient way to
grow crops might be to optimize the temperature, water, and nutrients
for each individual plant. We could monitor, water, weed, and prune
each plant individually. The machines could also experiment with
changes to these variables and find optimal settings. We could build a
data set of experiments for millions of individual plants rather than
entire fields.

## Who Will Pay For It?

We will. Our's will be the generation that provides this gift to all
of humanity's descendants.

## What Next?

We will debate ideas for
how to achieve our goals. Some members may start companies to
attempt to realize these goals.

## Inspiration: Carl Sagan speech at Cornell University, October 13, 1994

We succeeded in taking that picture, and, if you look at it,
you see a dot. That's here. That's home. That's us. On it,
everyone you ever heard of, every human being who ever lived,
lived out their lives. The aggregate of all our joys and
sufferings, thousands of confident religions, ideologies and
economic doctrines, every hunter and forager, every hero and
coward, every creator and destroyer of civilizations, every king
and peasant, every young couple in love, every hopeful child,
every mother and father, every inventor and explorer, every
teacher of morals, every corrupt politician, every superstar,
every supreme leader, every saint and sinner in the history of our
species, lived there â€“ on a mote of dust, suspended in a
sunbeam.

The Earth is a very small stage in a vast cosmic arena. Think of
the rivers of blood spilled by all those generals and emperors so that
in glory and in triumph they could become the momentary masters of a
fraction of a dot. Think of the endless cruelties visited by the
inhabitants of one corner of the dot on scarcely distinguishable
inhabitants of some other corner of the dot. How frequent their
misunderstandings, how eager they are to kill one another, how fervent
their hatreds. Our posturings, our imagined self-importance, the
delusion that we have some privileged position in the universe, are
challenged by this point of pale light.

To my mind, there is perhaps no better demonstration of the
folly of human conceits than this distant image of our tiny
world. To me, it underscores our responsibility to deal more
kindly and compassionately with one another and to preserve and
cherish that pale blue dot, the only home we've ever known.
