  <p><div class="header">Goal</div>
  Nobody on Earth lacks the basics: food, water, clothing, shelter, medical care, and security.
  </p>

  <p><div class="header">Why Now?</div> We are at a unique period of
  history where we have the technology and motivation to actually make
  this happen. We can do this without forcing our will upon those who
  don't want to help. 
  </p>

  <p><div class="header">Non-Goals</div> Inequality of wealth is
    irrelevant to our goal. We don't care that some have more than
    others as long as those with the least have a life with dignity.
  </p>

  <p><div class="header">Methods</div>
    Drive the cost of basic versions of these goods to zero, or as close to zero as possible.
    Then provide everyone on earth with enough universal basic income to buy these goods.</p>

    <p>
      Let's take these two statements as a given: 1. We are already extremely productive as a society
      and 2. Our productivity will accelerate as robotics and machine intelligence take over
      a greater percentage of our work.
  </p>  

  <p>
      Machines can do things that would be absurdly time consuming, not
      to mention annoying, for humans. For example, the most efficient
      way to grow crops might be to optimize the temperature, water, and
      nutrients for each individual plant. We could monitor, water, weed,
      and prune each plant individually. The machines could also experiment
      with changes to these variables and find optimal settings. We could
      build a data set of experiments for millions of individual plants rather
      than entire fields.
  </p>

  <p><div class="header">Who Will Pay For It?</div>
    We will. Our's will be the generation that provides this gift to all of humanity's descendants.
  </p>

  <p><div class="header">What Next?</div>  We will debate ideas for
    how to achieve our goals. Some members may start companies to
    attempt to realize these goals.

    <p>We succeeded in taking that picture, and, if you look at it,
    you see a dot. That's here. That's home. That's us. On it,
    everyone you ever heard of, every human being who ever lived,
    lived out their lives. The aggregate of all our joys and
    sufferings, thousands of confident religions, ideologies and
    economic doctrines, every hunter and forager, every hero and
    coward, every creator and destroyer of civilizations, every king
    and peasant, every young couple in love, every hopeful child,
    every mother and father, every inventor and explorer, every
    teacher of morals, every corrupt politician, every superstar,
    every supreme leader, every saint and sinner in the history of our
    species, lived there â€“ on a mote of dust, suspended in a
    sunbeam.</p>

<p>The Earth is a very small stage in a vast cosmic arena. Think of
the rivers of blood spilled by all those generals and emperors so that
in glory and in triumph they could become the momentary masters of a
fraction of a dot. Think of the endless cruelties visited by the
inhabitants of one corner of the dot on scarcely distinguishable
inhabitants of some other corner of the dot. How frequent their
misunderstandings, how eager they are to kill one another, how fervent
their hatreds. Our posturings, our imagined self-importance, the
delusion that we have some privileged position in the universe, are
challenged by this point of pale light.</p>

    <p>To my mind, there is perhaps no better demonstration of the
    folly of human conceits than this distant image of our tiny
    world. To me, it underscores our responsibility to deal more
    kindly and compassionately with one another and to preserve and
    cherish that pale blue dot, the only home we've ever known.</p>
